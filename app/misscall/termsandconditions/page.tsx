						These terms and conditions apply to the MissedCall - SMS Auto reply
						app (hereby referred to as &quot;Application&quot;) for mobile devices that
						was created by Sergey Dushevski (hereby referred to as &quot;Service
						Provider&quot;) as an Ad Supported service.
					</p>
					<p>
						Upon downloading or utilizing the Application, you are automatically
						agreeing to the following terms. It is strongly advised that you
						thoroughly read and understand these terms prior to using the
						Application.
					</p>
					<p>
						Unauthorized copying, modification of the Application, any part of
						the Application, or our trademarks is strictly prohibited. Any
						attempts to extract the source code of the Application, translate
						the Application into other languages, or create derivative versions
						are not permitted. All trademarks, copyrights, database rights, and
						other intellectual property rights related to the Application remain
						the property of the Service Provider.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Service Provider is dedicated to ensuring that the Application
						is as beneficial and efficient as possible. As such, they reserve
						the right to modify the Application or charge for their services at
						any time and for any reason. The Service Provider assures you that
						any charges for the Application or its services will be clearly
						communicated to you.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Application stores and processes personal data that you have
						provided to the Service Provider in order to provide the Service. It
						is your responsibility to maintain the security of your phone and
						access to the Application. The Service Provider strongly advise
						against jailbreaking or rooting your phone, which involves removing
						software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official
						operating system of your device. Such actions could expose your
						phone to malware, viruses, malicious programs, compromise your
						phone&#39;s security features, and may result in the Application not
						functioning correctly or at all.

						<p>
							Please note that the Application utilizes third-party services
							that have their own Terms and Conditions. Below are the links to
							the Terms and Conditions of the third-party service providers used

					</div>
					<p>
						Please be aware that the Service Provider does not assume
						responsibility for certain aspects. Some functions of the
						Application require an active internet connection, which can be
						Wi-Fi or provided by your mobile network provider. The Service
						Provider cannot be held responsible if the Application does not
						function at full capacity due to lack of access to Wi-Fi or if you
						have exhausted your data allowance.
					</p>
					<p>
						If you are using the application outside of a Wi-Fi area, please be
						aware that your mobile network provider&#39;s agreement terms still
						apply. Consequently, you may incur charges from your mobile provider
						for data usage during the connection to the application, or other
						third-party charges. By using the application, you accept
						responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data charges
						if you use the application outside of your home territory (i.e.,
						region or country) without disabling data roaming. If you are not
						the bill payer for the device on which you are using the
						application, they assume that you have obtained permission from the
						bill payer.
					</p>
					<p>
						Similarly, the Service Provider cannot always assume responsibility
						for your usage of the application. For instance, it is your
						responsibility to ensure that your device remains charged. If your
						device runs out of battery and you are unable to access the Service,
						the Service Provider cannot be held responsible.
					</p>
					<p>
						In terms of the Service Provider&#39;s responsibility for your use of
						the application, it is important to note that while they strive to
						ensure that it is updated and accurate at all times, they do rely on
						third parties to provide information to them so that they can make
						it available to you. The Service Provider accepts no liability for
						any loss, direct or indirect, that you experience as a result of
						relying entirely on this functionality of the application.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Service Provider may wish to update the application at some
						point. The application is currently available as per the
						requirements for the operating system (and for any additional
						systems they decide to extend the availability of the application
						to) may change, and you will need to download the updates if you
						want to continue using the application. The Service Provider does
						not guarantee that it will always update the application so that it
						is relevant to you and/or compatible with the particular operating
						system version installed on your device. However, you agree to
						always accept updates to the application when offered to you. The
						Service Provider may also wish to cease providing the application
						and may terminate its use at any time without providing termination
						notice to you. Unless they inform you otherwise, upon any
						termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these
						terms will end; (b) you must cease using the application, and (if
						necessary) delete it from your device.
